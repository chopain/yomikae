**Bridge Your Chinese Knowledge to Japanese Mastery**

Already know Chinese? Learn Japanese kanji faster using what you already know. Yomikae (読み替え, meaning "reading conversion") is designed specifically for Chinese speakers learning Japanese, helping you leverage your existing character knowledge while avoiding common pitfalls.

**Why Yomikae?**

Learning Japanese kanji can feel daunting, but if you know Chinese, you already have a massive head start. Most kanji share roots with Chinese characters, and understanding these connections accelerates your learning dramatically. Yomikae bridges your Chinese knowledge to Japanese reading mastery.

**Key Features**

🌉 DUAL READING SYSTEM
- See both Chinese (pinyin, simplified, traditional) and Japanese readings (onyomi, kunyomi) side by side
- Understand character meanings in both languages
- Learn how characters evolved and diverged

⚠️ FALSE FRIENDS DATABASE
- 40+ carefully curated "false friend" characters that look the same but mean different things
- Avoid embarrassing mistakes from assuming Chinese meanings
- Learn the actual Japanese usage with examples
- Categorized by severity (critical, high, moderate, low)

📚 COMPREHENSIVE CHARACTER DATABASE
- Searchable library of common kanji
- Japanese readings with JLPT level indicators
- Chinese readings with pinyin
- Stroke count, radicals, and frequency rankings
- Real-world usage examples

🎯 SMART LEARNING
- Search by character, meaning, or reading
- Bookmark characters for later review
- Track your learning history
- Focus on high-frequency characters first

**Who Is This For?**

✓ Chinese speakers (Mandarin or Cantonese) learning Japanese
✓ Heritage Chinese learners studying Japanese
✓ Advanced Japanese learners wanting Chinese context
✓ Anyone interested in CJK (Chinese-Japanese-Korean) character relationships
✓ Students preparing for JLPT exams

**What Makes Yomikae Different?**

Unlike generic kanji learning apps, Yomikae is built from the ground up for Chinese speakers. We don't just show you characters—we show you how they relate to what you already know. Our false friends feature is unique, helping you avoid the most common mistakes Chinese speakers make when learning Japanese.

**Learning Philosophy**

Traditional kanji learning apps treat characters as isolated symbols. Yomikae treats them as bridges between two rich linguistic traditions. By understanding both the similarities and differences between Chinese and Japanese character usage, you develop a deeper, more intuitive grasp of both languages.

**Perfect For**

- Self-study learners looking for an edge
- Students supplementing formal Japanese classes
- Chinese speakers curious about Japanese
- Language enthusiasts exploring East Asian linguistics
- Anyone preparing for JLPT N5-N1 exams
